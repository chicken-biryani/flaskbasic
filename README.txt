ABOUT:	These are VERY basic programs of flask that I learnt/am learning from youtube

Condintions:
	1) pip install flask
	
while running:
	Step 1:  *if on linux- export FLASK_APP=flaskblog.py (flaskblog.py is the program's name,so instead of flaskblog type in your
			      program's name)
		 *if on windows- set FLASK_APP=flaskblog.py
	Step 2(optional):
		*set FLASK_DEBUG=1 (this is so that you can just reload the page other than quitting program again and again )
	Step 3:
		* flask run (you'll see  'Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/' copy the 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/')
	Step 4: 
		*paste the 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/', as a url in your browser
	Step 5:
		*To quit press ctrl+c
